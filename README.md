# üèÖ Olympic_Medals_Analysis

This project is a comprehensive exploration of Olympic medal data spanning over 100 years, designed to uncover trends, patterns, and insights into the performance of athletes, countries, and sports. Built using Python with libraries such as Pandas, Seaborn, and Matplotlib, this analysis provides visualizations and statistical breakdowns to highlight the evolution of the Olympics.

## Overview
This repository contains code and data analysis focused on:

* Top Medal Winners: Identifying the athletes and countries with the most medals, including breakdowns by gender, sport, and decade.
* Gender Distribution: Analyzing the historical shift from male-dominated medal counts (approximately 70% in the past) toward near parity in recent Olympics.
* Sport Performance: Highlighting the top sports for women (e.g., Swimming with ~1600 medals) and men, with insights into individual vs. team sports.
* Country Success: Showcasing leading nations like the USA (5,305 medals) and the Soviet Union (2,061 medals) across various disciplines.
* Temporal Trends: Examining the upward trajectory of medal counts due to increased events, participating countries, and global expansion, with fluctuations noted in decades like the 1940s and 1950s.

## Features

* Data Visualization: Interactive bar plots, pie charts, and trend analyses to explore medal distributions.
* Custom Analysis: Code to filter and analyze data by decade, gender, and sport, with options to adapt to new datasets.
* Historical Context: Insights into how the Olympics evolved from a limited event to a global phenomenon.

## Libraries

The requirements.txt file includes:

* pandas
